✏️ Added :
- The date of death locations is now saved, and removed 6 months after (this can be changed with the option `daysToRemoveBackTp`)
- The properties files that were previously used to store locations and last death locations will be transferred to json files
- A command to remove the properties files (these files will be removed only by this command or by hand, so you can check if the files transferred properly)

🚧 Fixed :
- An unintended way of modifying the files from outside of the game which would change the values in-game, this is no longer possible
- The translations were not up to date in the `en_us.json` and `translations.properties` (now `translations.json`) files

🧪 Dev :
- The locations and locations for  the `/back` command are now stored using json files instead of properties
- The `Locations` and `BackTp` are now handled with classes instead of using just arrays
