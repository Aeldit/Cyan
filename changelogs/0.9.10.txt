ðŸš§ Fixed :
- The Y and Z coordinates where reversed
- The locations and death position were saved in the same folder independently of the solo world the player was in
- Locations and BackTp systems now use thread-safe classes (`ConcurrentHashMap()` and `Collections.synchronizedList()`)
  to prevent any problem with concurrent modifications (basically 2 people editing the homes (which then writes in the files) at the same time)

ðŸ«§ Changes :
- Use CyanLib 0.3.3
- Remove unnecessary modImplementation of the fabric api and use only the necessary ones
