ðŸŽ´ Update to 1.20

ðŸš§ Fixed :
- When editing the config via commands (ex: /cyan config allowBed set true), 2 messgages were send, one saying
`The option ... has been set to ...` + the message from the /cyan getConfig command
- When the game stopped and the backTp array was empty, instead of removing the file, an empty file was created
