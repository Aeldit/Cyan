0.9.8 :
    ✏️ Added :
    - The date of death locations is now saved, and removed 6 months after (this can be changed with the option `daysToRemoveBackTp`)
    - The properties files that were previously used to store locations and last death locations will be transferred to json files
    - A command to remove the properties files (these files will be removed only by this command or by hand, so you can check if the files transferred properly)

    🚧 Fixed :
    - An unintended way of modifying the files from outside of the game which would change the values in-game, this is no longer possible
    - The translations were not up to date in the `en_us.json` and `translations.properties` (now `translations.json`) files

    🧪 Dev :
    - The locations and locations for  the `/back` command are now stored using json files instead of properties
    - The `Locations` and `BackTp` are now handled with classes instead of using just arrays

0.9.9 :
    🎴 Update to 1.20

    🚧 Fixed :
    - When editing the config via commands (ex: /cyan config allowBed set true), 2 messgages were send, one saying
    `The option ... has been set to ...` + the message from the /cyan getConfig command
    - When the game stopped and the backTp array was empty, instead of removing the file, an empty file was created

0.9.10 :
    ✏️ Added :
    - The folders created by this mod are now removed if they are empty

    🚧 Fixed :
    - The Y and Z coordinates where reversed
    - The locations and death position were saved in the same folder independently of the solo world the player was in
    - Locations and BackTp systems now use thread-safe classes (`ConcurrentHashMap()` and `Collections.synchronizedList()`)
      to prevent any problem with concurrent modifications (basically 2 people editing the homes (which then writes in the files) at the same time)

    🫧 Changes :
    - Use CyanLib 0.3.3
    - Remove unnecessary modImplementation of the fabric api and use only the necessary apis

0.9.11 :
    🚧 Fixed :
    - Fixed the translations for the rules
    - The Locations and BackTps were not initialized on the server side, resulting in a crash on the server launch

0.9.12 :
    ✏️ Added :
    - The `/rename-location`, that allows you to rename a location

    🚧 Fixed :
    - The `get-locations` command was not checking for the value of `ALLOW_LOCATIONS`, so it was executed even if the option was set to OFF

    🫧 Changed :
    - Use CyanLib 0.3.5 (which allows me to remove the config commands from this mod, as they are now handled in the CyanLib)
    - (Only uses the last version, it's just to separate the features of each version)
      Use CyanLib 0.4.1 (which adds screen for the configuration on the client, only in solo for now)
