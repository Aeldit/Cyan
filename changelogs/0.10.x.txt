0.10.0 :
    ‚úèÔ∏è Added :

    - `/tpa` command : Allows players to ask for teleportation to another player
    - `allowTpa` option : toggles the `/tpa` command
    - `useXpToTeleport` option : consumes XP when the player uses teleportation commands (`/bed`, `/surface` and `/tpa`)
        - An option is available for each tp command (`blocksPerXpLevel...`, `...` being the command) to specify the amount
          of blocks that will consume 1 XP level

    üåà Changed :

    The custom translations are now handled differently :

    - if you want custom translations, you can simply put a file named `custom_lang.json` inside a folder named `cyan` in
      the config folder
    - the way to use another language is also by using this file, but by translating the default translations

    ‚ö†Ô∏è For now, only one language can be used, but support for multiple languages might come at some point

0.10.1 :
    Use CyanLib 0.4.7 to fix the config not being written when modified from the chat

0.10.3 :
    Fix multiple translation errors with the cyanlib
