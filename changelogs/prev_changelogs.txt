0.9.8 :
    ✏️ Added :
    - The date of death locations is now saved, and removed 6 months after (this can be changed with the option `daysToRemoveBackTp`)
    - The properties files that were previously used to store locations and last death locations will be transferred to json files
    - A command to remove the properties files (these files will be removed only by this command or by hand, so you can check if the files transferred properly)

    🚧 Fixed :
    - An unintended way of modifying the files from outside of the game which would change the values in-game, this is no longer possible
    - The translations were not up to date in the `en_us.json` and `translations.properties` (now `translations.json`) files

    🧪 Dev :
    - The locations and locations for  the `/back` command are now stored using json files instead of properties
    - The `Locations` and `BackTp` are now handled with classes instead of using just arrays

0.9.9 :
    🎴 Update to 1.20

    🚧 Fixed :
    - When editing the config via commands (ex: /cyan config allowBed set true), 2 messgages were send, one saying
    `The option ... has been set to ...` + the message from the /cyan getConfig command
    - When the game stopped and the backTp array was empty, instead of removing the file, an empty file was created

0.9.10 :
    ✏️ Added :
    - The folders created by this mod are now removed if they are empty

    🚧 Fixed :
    - The Y and Z coordinates where reversed
    - The locations and death position were saved in the same folder independently of the solo world the player was in
    - Locations and BackTp systems now use thread-safe classes (`ConcurrentHashMap()` and `Collections.synchronizedList()`)
      to prevent any problem with concurrent modifications (basically 2 people editing the homes (which then writes in the files) at the same time)

    🫧 Changes :
    - Use CyanLib 0.3.3
    - Remove unnecessary modImplementation of the fabric api and use only the necessary apis

0.9.11 :
    🚧 Fixed :
    - Fixed the translations for the rules
    - The Locations and BackTps were not initialized on the server side, resulting in a crash on the server launch

0.9.12 :
    ✏️ Added :
    - The `/rename-location`, that allows you to rename a location

    🚧 Fixed :
    - The `get-locations` command was not checking for the value of `ALLOW_LOCATIONS`, so it was executed even if the option was set to OFF

    🫧 Changed :
    - Use CyanLib 0.3.5 (which allows me to remove the config commands from this mod, as they are now handled in the CyanLib)
    - *(Only uses the last version, it's just to separate the features of each version)* Use CyanLib 0.4.1
      (which adds screen for the configuration on the client, only in solo for now)

0.9.14 :
    ✏️ Added :
    - Suggestions for the `rename-location`

    🚧 Fixed :
    - The message when renaming a location had weird colors

    🧪 Dev :
    - The function to get the locations names suggestion is now part of the Locations class, allowing the removing of the ArgumentSuggestion class

0.9.15 :
    🚧 Fixed :

    - The suggestion when renaming a location was suggesting for a new name instead of the actual location
    - The name of the singleplayer save is now obtained using a proper function

    🧪 Dev :

    - Simplified the code that obtains the dimension in which the player saved the location or died (called by
      the `/set-location` command or the `death event`)

0.10.0 :
    ✏️ Added :

    - `/tpa` command : Allows players to ask for teleportation to another player
    - `allowTpa` option : toggles the `/tpa` command
    - `useXpToTeleport` option : consumes XP when the player uses teleportation commands (`/bed`, `/surface` and `/tpa`)
        - An option is available for each tp command (`blocksPerXpLevel...`, `...` being the command) to specify the amount
          of blocks that will consume 1 XP level

    🌈 Changed :

    The custom translations are now handled differently :

    - if you want custom translations, you can simply put a file named `custom_lang.json` inside a folder named `cyan` in
      the config folder
    - the way to use another language is also by using this file, but by translating the default translations

    ⚠️ For now, only one language can be used, but support for multiple languages might come at some point

0.10.1 :
    Use CyanLib 0.4.7 to fix the config not being written when modified from the chat

0.10.3 :
    Fix multiple translation errors with the cyanlib

0.10.4 :
    Fix issue [#9](https://github.com/Aeldit/Cyan/issues/9) where the player's XP would be consumed when using the `tpa`
    command, even if the `UseXpToTeleport` option was set to `false`

0.10.5 :
    Allow the user to choose whether XP points or XP levels will be used when teleporting

0.11.0 :
    Add the `/cyan execute <command> <player_targets> <eventual_command_arguments>`.

    This command allows the OP users and the console of the server to execute a given command for the `player_targets` (can
    be player names or a selector like `@a`)

    The possible commands that go with it are :

    - `/bed`
    - `/surface`
    - `/location <location_name>`
