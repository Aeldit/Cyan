Add the `/cyan execute <command> <player_targets> <eventual_command_arguments>`.

This command allows the OP users and the console of the server to execute a given command for the `player_targets` (can
be player names or a selector like `@a`)

The possible commands that go with it are :

- `/bed`
- `/surface`
- `/location <location_name>`
