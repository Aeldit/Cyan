ðŸš§ Fixed :

- The suggestion when renaming a location was suggesting for a new name instead of the actual location
- The name of the singleplayer save is now obtained using a proper function

ðŸ§ª Dev :

- Simplified the code that obtains the dimension in which the player saved the location or died (called by
  the `/set-location` command or the `death event`)
