### üí≤Features

1. Teleport yourself to :
    - your bed / respawn anchor
    - the surface (highest block on your current position)

2. Save your current location so anyone can teleport to it
   (useful on servers where you don't want players to set a point but want to let them teleport to predefined ones)

3. Remove items that are floating on the ground (useful if there is a lot of them, which causes lag)

4. See and edit plenty of options, like the minimum OP level required to run a command, or the
   distance in which items will be removed

5. Teleport yourself back to the place you died (`/back` command)

6. Request to teleport to another player using the `/tpa` command

7. Consume XP when the player uses a teleportation command (`/bed`, `/surface`, `/tpa`)

8. Execute a command for all targets of a given selector (ex: `/cyan execute bed @a`)

### üåê Translations

This mod allows you to create and use custom translations or another language than english, instead of the default
messages.

To do this, go in the `config/cyan` folder of your minecraft instance / server and add the `fr_fr.json` file that
can be found [here](https://github.com/Aeldit/CyanLib/tree/1.20.4/custom_languages)

Once this is done, make sure to rename the file to `custom_lang.json` (for now, only one language can be loaded so every
player of the server will have the same language, but I might add multi-language support at some point)
