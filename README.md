# Cyan
Adds a few commands to Minecraft server but can also be used on singleplayer

IMPORTANT: If you are not using the version on client but only on server side, use the resource pack for the message translations. It is the file "Cyan.zip" located in the main branch of this project.

If you want some datapacks that works with this mod, you can download them in the Datapack file of this project
