### üí≤Features

1. Teleport yourself to :
    - your bed / respawn anchor
    - the surface (highest block on your current position)

2. Save your current location so anyone can teleport to it
   (useful on servers where you don't want players to set a point but want to let them teleport to predefined ones)

3. Remove items that are floating on the ground (useful if there is a lot of them, which causes lag)

4. See and edit plenty of options, like the minimum OP level required to run a command, or the
   distance in which items will be removed

5. Teleport yourself back to the place you died (`/back` command)

6. Plans for the future :

### üåê Default Translations

This mod allows you to create and use custom translations, instead of the default messages.

To do this :

1. Download the file `translations.json`
   located [here](https://github.com/Aeldit/Cyan/tree/1.20.x/docs) and put it in your Minecraft server
   folder (`minecraft/config/cyan`)
2. Then you can translate the file to any language you want
3. There are some unicode characters in the file (they look like `\u00A7c`). They are used to determine the
   color of the text so don't delete them unless you don't want the colors. If you want to change the colors, here
   is a link where you can find the [unicode colors](https://minecraft.tools/en/color-code.php)
4. There are translations that contains one or more `%s`. You must keep these in your translations, as they are the
   place the variables passed from functions are shown (ex: For the
   command `/kgi 16`, the message will be `Ground items have been removed in a radius of 16 chunks`. Here we have
   16 in the message, but because it was the argument of the command)

### ‚ùó Important

If you are not using this mod on client but only on server side, download the resource pack for messages translations
(Cyan 1.1X.x located in this mod's github repository)

üìñ If you launch the mod on server side, it will use the latest version of minecraft, but if you use it on client side,
it will allow you to play any version of the same number (ex: 1.17, 1.17.1 ...)
